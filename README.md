# Product Microservice

## Overview

The **Product Microservice** is part of the `ctcom` platform and handles product-related operations such as creating, updating, deleting, and retrieving products. It follows a microservice architecture with Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) principles using Kafka (or RabbitMQ) for event messaging.

This service is built using **.NET 8 Web API**, adhering to **SOLID principles** and ensuring scalability, separation of concerns, and ease of maintenance.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
- **Event Publishing**: Events such as `ProductCreated`, `ProductUpdated`, and `ProductDeleted` are published using Kafka/RabbitMQ.
- **Decoupled Design**: Follows SOLID principles, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
- **In-memory Data Store**: Currently using an in-memory list for product data storage. You can integrate with a persistent database (e.g., SQL Server, MongoDB).

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8 Web API**
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Docker** (for containerization)
- **Polly** (for resilience and retry logic)
- **RabbitMQ** (for message/event handling)
- **MassTransit** (for managing RabbitMQ)

## Endpoints
